## About üìñ

This is a website for my second-year BIS Multimedia module, IMY-220. The goal was to create an **events social-media site** (think tripAdvisor + Instagram) for uploading and viewing users' events, revieing events, following and messaging users - with a theme of your choice. The theme for this site is art and pop-culture based events, *artfolio*.

I decided to go for a modern, contemporary, "neo-pop" feel, with some historical art pieces thrown in for the feeling of "modernizing old art". The site is fully responsive & fully functional according to our spec, and can be used to upload/view/review events, follow users, and message users.

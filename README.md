IMY 220 | Events Website | 2022
## About:
This is a website for my second-year BIS Multimedia module, IMY-220. The goal was to create an events social-media site (think tripAdvisor + Instagram) for uploading and viewing users' events, revieing events, following and messaging users (with a theme of your choice). The theme for this site is art and pop-culture based events, *artfolio*.

I decided to go for a modern pop-art vibe, with some historical art pieces thrown in for the feeling of "modernizing old art". The site is not-yet fully responsive, but will be designed to be used on mobile devices. The site is also fully functional, and can be used to upload events, view events, review events, follow users, and message users.

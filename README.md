IMY 220 | Events Website
## About:
This is a website for my second-year module, IMY-220. The goal was to create an events site for uploading and viewing user's events (with a theme of your choice). The theme for this site is art and pop-culture based events. 

I decided to go for a modern pop-art vibe, with some historical art pieces thrown in for the feeling of "modernizing old art".
